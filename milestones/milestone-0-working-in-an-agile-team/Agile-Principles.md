# Research & Learn

## What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is an iteritative, cyclical model that consists of sprints, small work cycle. It allows the team to adjust to changes. Unlike agile, traditional project management is sequential and linear. It is not flexible. Each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next one.

## What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

The core values of Agile are the following:
1. Individual and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

The principles are the following:
1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

For scrum, it is a fixed-length iterations called Sprints. There is a product owner, scrum master, and development team involved in this. In every sprint, there is sprint planning, sprint, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. This is to quickly adapt and integrate customer feedback. Kanban has workflow stages such as To Do, In Progres, In Review, Blocked, and Done, but it is not limited to those. It is a continuous workflow and adapt to changing priorities. Unlike scrum, it does not have to wait for sprint review. It is good for teams that has a lot of requests that vary in priority and size.

## Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum because of its flexibility and the need to address feature requests or bugs the moment they arise. Priorities can be changed in an instant and developers are able to work on their own pace without waiting for the next sprint.

# Reflection

## What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

Benefits of agile are the following:
1. Adaptability to changes
2. Customer Satisfaction wherein customer stays engaged and sees constant progress
3. Ensures higher quality because bugs are detected earlier and less costly to fix.
4. The team is able to organize theirselves and how to solve a problem.

Challenges of agile are the following:

1. Because agile is open to changes, certain goals may not be given enough focus.
2. Documentation is less important.
3. It is hard to predict final cost and final date for release.

## How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile principles can help me become more adaptive, engage on team collaboration, and efficient in doing tasks.

# Task

## Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

Scrum is an iterative, cyclical model that breaks down work into something smaller and achievable in 2-4 weeks. Kanban is flexible and adaptive to changes where everything "goes with the flow" and continuous. 

## Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

The Agile principle that will be most useful is to continuously deliver valuable software and satisfy customer. This encourages me as a developer to ensure that my output is quality and meaningful.
