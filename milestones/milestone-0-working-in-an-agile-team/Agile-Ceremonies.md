# Research & Learn

## What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
- Daily Stand-ups - Brief 15-minute syncs where the team discusses progress and identifies blockers.
- Sprint Planning (Scrum) - A session to define the goal and select backlog items for the upcoming sprint.
- Continuous Prioritization (Kanban) - the Product Manager updates the top of the To-Do column as soon as capacity opens up.
- Retrospectives - A meeting at the end of a cycle to reflect on what went well and identify areas for process improvement.
- Backlog Refinement - An ongoing process where the team reviews and clarifies future tasks to ensure they are "ready" for development.

## How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

Documentation helps other co-members to see progress and help understand modifications made. Members can see it in their own time. There are also centralized project management tools such as Jira, Trello, and Miro. It allows members to brainstorm without real-time participation. If done asynchronoysly, recorded video updates are done. Strategic overlap hours can be done to discuss high-priority sessions.

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

These agile ceremonies allow members to synchornize goals, share progress, and address blocking. It ensures that each members are on the same page regarding priorities. It prevents miscommunication and prevents silos.

## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

It is the daily stand-up ceremony because I am able to share my progress and address issues. It enables me to communicate to my team my work capacity and prevent me from getting overwhelmed from the workload. 

# Task

In the stand-up meeting, each interns give quick updates of their progress and if there are any issues they faced or currently working on. This is where each of us can ask for help or set another meeting if it is a recurring or unsolved issue.

In improving team collaboration, I think asking for clarifications and questions more can help me understand or navigate where to start or fix an issue.
