# Research & Learn

## What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
- Developers. Build the product — including frontend, backend, and mobile engineers. They are the ones who technically implement a feature and responsible for the quality of code.
- QA (Quality Assurance). Collaborates with developers to ensure that the output is of quality, follows the requirement, and write tests.
- Product Manager (PM). Communicates with the customer  to help them understand the progress, challenges, and prioritization of the development. They ensure that the team's work aligns with the company's goals.
- Agile Project Manager (Agile PM). Supports the team by clearing what stops the team from working. They facilitate meetings and ensure that the team follows Agile principles.
- Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support). Provide the strategic feedback, user-centric design, and real-world insights necessary to refine the product.

## How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
|Roles|Kanban|Scrum |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Developers|Pull tasks continuously based on capacity and sync with the team as blockers arise.|Commit to a set of tasks for sprint and collaborate during Daily Standups.|
|QA (Quality Assurance)|Test items as soon as they are ready to keep the flow moving |Focus on testing all Sprint items to ensure they meet the "Definition of Done" before the Sprint ends.|
|Product Manager (PM)|Refine the backlog in real-time and provide just-in-time priority updates for the next available "pull."|Prioritize the backlog before Sprint Planning and avoid changing requirements during the active Sprint.|
|Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)|Monitor the board for bottlenecks and facilitate "stop-the-line" huddles to resolve workflow issues.|Protect the team from outside distractions and facilitate structured ceremonies like Retrospectives.|
|Supporting roles|Provide feedback (Support) and design assets (UX) asynchronously or as needed per active ticket.|Participate in Sprint Reviews to provide feedback on the increment and plan for future Sprints.|

# Reflection

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role is developer as a mobile app developer intern. I deliver tasks in relation to frontend and backend given its deadline. I do engage with standups, planning, and review.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

For technical requirements, I reach out to the Product Manager to ensure that the deliverables are met. After I finish a task/feature, I collaborate with the QA to test my progress if it requires fix and is up to standard. With the Agile Project Manager, I report my progress and blockers if there are any. If I have any issues, I reach out to them to ensure I accomplish my task before the daedline. For supporting roles, I work closely with the UI/UX designers to ensure that the user interface "blueprint" is followed. 

# Task

## Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

I work as a mobile app developer intern. I do frontend and backend tasks and part of it is to collaborate with the team, report progress, backlogs, and issues.

## Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

I frequently collaborate with QA because in every task, I have to let the QA check my implementation if there are no fix needed and to ensure my work is up to standard. Communication is important and letting each other understand the code. Feedback is a must for improvement.
