# Research and Learn

## What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

1. Phishing & Deepfakes
2. Ransomware
3. Unsecured home Wi-Fi, networks
4. Man-in-the-Middle attacks
5. Bring Your Own Devices
6. Poor password management
7. Unencrypted files

## What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

1. Use unique and strong passwords. Different passwords for each account.
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or multiple factor authentication (MFA).
3. Have anti-virus and firewall.
4. Use password managers.
5. Only grant access to necessary data. Never give access unless required.
6. Always set a time to make devices sleep/inactive. This will require a user to enter password again.
7. Backup sensitive information. Do not give it away to other people and not even with family or friends.

## Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

It allows data protection. No unauthorized access will be allowed. No one else can send files or make modifications under someone else's identity. It also adds physical security so no drive-by attacks can happen.

## How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

Always check if the link provided redirects to exactly what the link shows through hovering over that provided link. Additionally, check the sender's email address if it is actually the real one. Go to the source and ensure that the account is actually still accessible and no malicious logs happened. Never place credentials from those email links provided.

## What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

A strong password consists 12 or more characters that are of variation like symbols, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, etc. in combination. Password manager helps in generating unique passwords and store these passwords for each account. This prevents phishing and credential stuffing attacks. 

## Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

2FA is important to ensure that the user who is trying to login is the actual owner of the account. It provides layer of verification before accessing to an account. It should be enable as soon as the account is up. It should be done by default.

# Reflection

## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

Currently, I do 2 Factor Authentication across all of my accounts. I also do not click links especially provided by banks, unknown numbers, etc. I keep myself updated to what establishments do with their customers like not giving away OTPs, not taking the bait when a link is sent, etc. I think I can improve on managing my passwords. Sometimes, I do save it somewhere in my phone and I might forget to transfer it to my password manager.

## How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

In order to make a secure behaviour a habit, it must be a conscious effort to do prevention and be cautious. Always follow best practices and give importance to data protection. Setting a reminder to change passwords every 2-3 months is a step.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

1. Use password managers.
2. Have a strong password through having 12 or more characters that are of variation like different symbols, cases, numbers, etc. combined.
3. Avoid using birthday and common passwords.
4. Do 2 Factor Authentication or Multiple Factor Authentication.
5. Never store passwords in online platforms or share it with other people.

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

I would immediately log out all of my accounts across all devices. Change my password. I would also report this incident to the appropriate people who will help me handle this case.
