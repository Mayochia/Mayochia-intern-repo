# Research & Learn

## Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

- Elderly - lower digital literacy and physical/cognitive impairments
- People with Disabilities - visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments who may struggle with inaccessible web design
- Low-income Households - incapability to purchase gadgets and pay for internet access
- Rural/Remote Communities - inadequate, poor-quality internet infrastructure
- Racial and Ethnic Minorities - racism, cyberbullying, systemic biases and language barrier
- Children and Youth - cyberbullying, inappropriate media content, data exploitation
- Migrants and Refugees - language barrier
- Marginalized groups - limited outside contact

## What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

1. Avoid overwhelming users through reducing cognitive load. Too much visual noise can confuse users.
2. Respecting sensory needs like having a sensory-friendly reminders.
3. Always practice giving explicit instructions, asynchronous options, and direct but respectful feedback.
4. Allow customization.
5. Minimize distractions.

## How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

Use clear and direct language. Another is to make things predictable and structured. Open communication, support asynchrounous option, and progress retention are necessary.

## How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

Practice direct communication. Be respectful with other people's differences in work styles. Implment radical flexibility. Lastly, it is to provide structured feedback. It will help motivate neurodivergent team members and encourage them even more.

# Reflection

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can adopt literal and direct language. If there are verbal meetings, there must be minutes of the meeting. Another thing that could be helpful is to provide agendas in advance. Respecting other's processing time and focus is important because not everyone is the same.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

I think having a cluttered and overwhelming UX can does not result to a good outcome. It will be hard to navigate and be of a lesser user-friendly interface. It also adds another time to familiarize navigating the application.

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

I think simplifying the UI and its routing to make it less of a hassle. It is easier to grasp the functionality of a system in that way. Always have in mind to keep the design minimal and make it sensory-friendly.

## Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

In the To Do Player, it could be better if it is also synced with the time if Focus Session starts. I noticed that if I do Focus Session and add tasks in the To Do Player, the time is not synced with each other so there might be issues with when a task is finished. Other than this, I think customization of appearance can help but still having design considerations.

## Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.

Hypothetical User Struggle:
"I have so much to do for my project and I don’t even know where to start. Every time I look at my list, I feel overwhelmed and just end up doing nothing. I feel like I'm falling behind."

The Supportive Response:
"I hear you, and it is completely normal to feel 'stuck' when a project has many parts. This happens because your brain is currently having a hard time deciding which task to do first. You aren't falling behind; you just need a clear, simple path to follow. Let us try to dissect this in smaller parts and pick one thing to focus on. After that, take a break before moving on to the next. You will reach your goal. I will support you along the way."
