## What are best practices for handling confidential data?

Follow the Principle of Least Privilege. Limit access. Allow access to what is needed only. Use encrypption and hashing. Mask and anonymize data to avoid exposing real user data. Place credentials inside environment variables. Securely delete any local copies of sensitive datasets. Do not store sensitive information in unsecure locations.

## How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information?

Contain the breach immediately. Revoke access. Delete or modify content as soon as possible to prevent further views. Disconnect device from internet to prevent data exfiltration. Report the incident to the supervisor. Be transparent of what happened. Document the incident with the root cause and proposed fix in it. Always follow regulatory and company protocols.

# Reflection

## What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

No hard coding credentials. Use environment variables. Practice disk encryption, automatic lock, and VPN use if connected to public or unsecured Wi-Fi. Use mock data instead of the "live" data. Implement pre-commit security checks to catch mistakes before saving it to history. Do not keep passwords, keys, tokens and the like in clipboard. Use encrypted channnel and never send raw credentials in the text.

## How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

The data must remain unreadable which can be achieved through using strong encryption, environment variables, and do hashing. Use secure platforms. Never share credentials over standard email. Use encrypted "secret sharing" tools. Allow access only to authorized recipients. Deletion of data and information should only be done according to GDPR and company policies.

## What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

1. Sharing credentials to other people over digital platform or personally. Never share sensitive information and credentials to other people.
2. Weak passwords. Create a unique and strong password.
3. No 2FA or MFA. Enable this to every account possible.
4. Downloading applications that may contain virus or in untrusted source. Only download to secured platforms.

# Task

## Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.

As an intern, I value data privacy. I will encrypt data and never touch or access files/links that are not required for me. I will ensure that before committing, no sensitive information will be pushed.

## Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.

I will implement secure storage for all sensitive authentication tokens and PII. If in case my phone is lost or stolen, the data is encrypted. I should verify no sensitive data will be pushed to history.
