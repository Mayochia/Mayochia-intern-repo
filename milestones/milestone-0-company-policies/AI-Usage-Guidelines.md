# Research & Learn

## What AI tools are typically used for your role?
 
I use Github Copilot. GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 are also some of the AI tools typically used for my role. I use VSCode and these are the models available in it.

## What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?

Benefits of using AI in a professional setting includes increased productivity and efficiency, help provide solutions in fixing bugs or errors, lessen human error, help do repetitive jobs like generating reports, and explain complex problems. In the risk of using AI, if a user has mistakenly given private information, it will be exposed and allow AI to have an access in it. Another is fully depending on AI when acccomplishing tasks and delivering output. 

## What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?

Confidential information should never be fed into AI tools. This can let AI have access to this and might be accessed publicly.

## How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?

To ensure accuracy, AI-generated content must be cross-checked with reliable and authorized resources. There are other tools that also detects AI-generated content. Be keen on the details if it does match with factual data.

# Reflection

##  When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

Always keep in mind that AI is just a tool made for assistance. Do majority of the work such as programming logic, algorithms, and decision-making, and use AI for debugging, documentations, or suggestion for solutions. 

## How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

Verify and review what is provided by the AI if it actually helps. It is just a second opinion. Actions like practicing critical-thinking, building strong learning habits, and engaging in real-world problem-solving can help in improving oneself as a developer.

## What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

1. DO NOT input confidential, proprietary, or PII.
2. Disable training opt-in because some tools use input data to train future models. Limit permissions and give access when only necessary.
3. Invest on secure tools and platforms. Enterprise versions has better data privacy, non-disclosure agreements, and no data input will be used for training models.
4. Follow organizational policies.

# Task

## Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.

I am part of an organization in my university, CoDE, and I have to deal with lengthy documents. I use AI to summarize and outline necessary details to make it easier for me to approve documents.

## Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?

The AI-generated output required editing because there are minor details that has to be edited out. The prompt has to be specific and well stated in order for AI to achieve the best output it can give. Basically, it still needs reviewing.

## Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.

I use AI just for debugging, reading documentation and understanding code. I do not use it for complete writing my logic. I may use it for syntax errors. I will always review and study its output before approving it.
